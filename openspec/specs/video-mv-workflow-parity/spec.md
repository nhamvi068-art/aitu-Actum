### Requirement: Shared Generation Reset
The system SHALL provide a consistent "reset generated assets" action for both video analyzer and MV creator generation pages.

- **WHEN** the user clicks the reset action
- **THEN** generated asset URLs and suppressed generated URLs are cleared
- **AND** character reference images are cleared
- **AND** script content, selected models, and workflow versions remain unchanged

### Requirement: Shared ZIP Export Contract
The system SHALL export generated workflow assets from both video analyzer and MV creator using the same ZIP manifest contract.

#### Scenario: Export video analyzer assets
- **GIVEN** a video analyzer record has generated assets
- **WHEN** the user exports the workflow assets
- **THEN** the ZIP contains the script markdown, manifest file, download helper script, and generated shot assets
- **AND** the manifest keeps the shared structure used by MV creator
- **AND** music-related fields are empty when no music asset exists
